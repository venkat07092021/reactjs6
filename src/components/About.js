      <h2>About Me</h2>
     <h3>Hello, I'm Venkata Sai Pranav, a passionate and driven individual currently in my third year of pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) degree at VIT AP University. I have a keen interest in Artificial Intelligence and I am dedicated  my skills in this domain.

Throughout my academic journey, I've not only excelled in my coursework but also actively sought out opportunities to apply my knowledge in practical settings. I believe in the power of hands-on experience to complement theoretical learning.

n addition to my technical pursuits, I'm a firm believer in holistic development. I actively participate in 3 clubs on campus, where I've had the chance to collaborate with diverse teams and develop valuable soft skills such as communication, leadership, and problem-solving.

Looking forward,I'm eager to explore the fields and contribute to meaningful projects that make a positive impact.</h3>
